# Shuffle-simulator
Analysis of different kinds of shuffles

Shuffles.py contains three shuffles implemented in python

VisualizeShuffles.py does the following:
* Runs various shuffles a set number of times on the same 'deck'
* Outputs the shuffling process as an mp4 file in /Video/
* Outputs the state of the deck after each shuffle as a PNG in /Shuffles/
* Outputs a graph of the correlations in /Plots/

# Requirements
* [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [opencv](https://opencv.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (only required for correlation graphs)
